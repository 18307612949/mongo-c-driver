# The upstream libmongoc bundles zLib and Snappy for compression support
# on systems where these libraries are not available. The Debian package does
# not build using this embedded libraries, it uses zlib1g-dev and libsnappy-dev.
# Upstream will delete this extraneous binary in the next release:
# https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CDRIVER-2288
